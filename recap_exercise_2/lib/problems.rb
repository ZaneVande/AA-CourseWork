class Array
    # Write a method, Array#pair_sum_count, that takes in a target number returns the number of pairs of elements that sum to the given target
    def pair_sum_count(num)

    # Write a method, Array#bubble_sort, that takes in an optional proc argument.
    # When given a proc, the method should sort the array according to the proc.
    # When no proc is given, the method should sort the array in increasing order.
    #
    # Sorting algorithms like bubble_sort, commonly accept a block. That block accepts
    # two parameters, which represents the two elements in the array being compared.
    # If the block returns 1, it means that the second element passed to the block
    # should go before the first (i.e. switch the elements). If the block returns -1,
    # it means the first element passed to the block should go before the second
    # (i.e. do not switch them). If the block returns 0 it implies that
    # it does not matter which element goes first (i.e. do nothing).
    #
    # This should remind you of the spaceship operator! Convenient :)
